[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/stark-db.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stark-db)

SQLite-backed, change-tracking database available over HTTP.


## Installation

```bash
npm i -g stark-db
```

## Basics

Run with:

```bash
stark-db
```

By default, the DB engine is configured to run over SSL. While some self-signed
ssl certificates are automatically generated, they are not ever valid so
the user must supply their own. Then, the user needs to set the `-c` flag
in order to enable the cookie security. Only then is this system ready for
use in production.

There is a Swagger endpoint `https://127.0.0.1:5984/api-docs` where the user can
try out the routes available.

This database tracks changes to all entities in the auto-created column(on all
tables) `stark_version`. There is also an extra table generated with any
user-created table called `_stark_del_${name}`. Deletions are tracked
in this auxiliary set of tables. With the help of this change tracking,
synchronization mechanisms can be built later. The user has the option
of using soft deletion -- marking data as deleted -- or relying on an
`id` column to track such deletions. ROWID would not work in a synchronization
scenario. Any modifications made by stark-db to the sqlite database
can be seen by running `select * from sqlite_master;` and the user can edit the
triggers/tables.
Also, the `-f` flag prevents all modifications related to change tracking.

## CLI

```bash
  -a, --address <address>  HTTP address to listen on (default: "127.0.0.1")
  -i, --doc <address>      Address to query by the documentation (default: "https://127.0.0.1")
  -p, --port <port>        HTTP port to listen on (default: "5983")
  -s, --ssl <port>         HTTPS port to listen on (default: "5984")
  -c, --cookie             Secure cookie, served over valid HTTPS only (default: false)
  -d, --data <path>        Path to the data directory (default: "./data")
  -k, --certs <path>       Path to the certs directory (default: "./certs")
  -f, --simple             Do not run change-tracking queries (default: false)
  -h, --help               display help for command
```
